# RevealJS Starter

This is my starter template for RevealJS slides. All the files are static and there is no build system. Clone the repo and remove `.git` and then add your slides to `index.html`.

You could then host the slides on github pages by setting the repo to serve all contents from the root of the repo.

For local development serve the files with a development server.

```
python -m http.server
```

or

```
browser-sync --serveStatic --files "index.html"
```

See the [reveal.js documentation](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) for adding slide content.
